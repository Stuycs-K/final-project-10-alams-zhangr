## Overview

Our project is a recreation of a tower defense game based on the popular video game Arknights. Unlike typical tower defense games, Arknights’ includes RPG elements where the “towers” are characters and they attack enemies that try to reach the base. The maps are divided into ground and aerial units that determine character placement. There are different character archetypes: defenders, healers, and snipers that each play a different role. Defenders are ground units that attack and block enemies directly when they are in range or on their block. Snipers are aerial units that attack all enemies in their range but do not block them. Healers are aerial units that heal other characters. There are also different enemy archetypes. All enemies are ground units. Sniper enemies target aerial characters in their range. Attacker enemies attack characters they run into. The goal of the game is to defeat all enemies before our life point reaches 0. Life points decrease for every enemy that enters the base.

## Instructions

On Processing, click play to run the game. A menu should appear in which players could choose one of three levels.
Once on a level, enemies will start to traverse the map and players would need to place down characters to combat
these enemies. Players can do so by clicking on a square and pressing a number from 1 to 6 on the keyboard that
corresponds with the character they want to place down. After clicking a square and selecting the number, players then
need to press either w, a, s, or d, which determine the direction of the characters (up, left, down, and right
respectively). At the end of a level (when a win or lose screen appears), players will go back to the menu and they
could then select another level (or the same level) to play.
